# R-Machine-Learning-Competition
Project for M.S. Business Analytics and Information Management course Statistical and Machine Learning. Tackling machine learning prediction of property sales price as a regression estimate, given 81 variables both catagorical and numeric. Programming done in R, with use of Excel.

This ML competition was really exciting, and I was happy to have finished 3rd in the class of over 25 people. It taught me a lot about programming in R, and data mining in commercial settings like real estate.

Thanks for your consideration in viewing my project, I really appreciate you giving me a look.

Best regards, Alex Baker. :)
